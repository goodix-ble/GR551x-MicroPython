The GR551x-MicroPython project
=======================

[EN](README.md)  |  [中](README_zh.md)

>  Attention: 

>  This is an interest project, and will not gain long-term support. you can study how to port and develop the system layer code for micro-python through this project and how to define PNI (python-native interface) for python-versioned-BLE. 



## 1. Project Information

- MicroPython : You can learn from the  [MicroPython - a lean and efficient Python implementation for microcontrollers and constrained systems ](https://github.com/micropython/micropython)

- GR551x : A single-mode, low-power Bluetooth 5.1 System-on-Chip (SoC). It can be configured as a Broadcaster, an Observer, a Central, a Peripheral, and supports the combination of all the above roles, making it an ideal choice for Internet of Things (IoT) and smart wearable devices.

  Based on ARM® Cortex®-M4F CPU core, the GR551x integrates Bluetooth 5.1 Protocol Stack, a 2.4 GHz RF transceiver, on-chip programmable Flash memory, RAM, and multiple peripherals.

- Develop Board: Based on GR5515 SK

## 2. Porting Guide

- Please view the porting guide through by project wiki, it just provides chinese version now
